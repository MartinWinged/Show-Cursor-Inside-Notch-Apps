As every Notch user knows - Notch .exe application when run by default hides cursor.
If you would like to make an App in which you use cursor as interaction - you are doomed...
Are you? Nope, no more! :D

This script detects active Notch .exe files and displays overlay cursor on top so you can see your mouse as you would see it in Notch Builder.

Run Show Cursor Inside Notch Apps.exe and then run Notch application. Cursor should pop up by itself. To close the script simply press ESC.

Peace!
