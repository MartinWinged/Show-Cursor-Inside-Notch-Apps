___ DESCRIPTION ___

As every Notch user knows - Notch .exe application when run by default hides cursor.
If you would like to make an App in which you use cursor as interaction - you are doomed...
Are you? Nope, no more! :D

This script detects active Notch .exe files and displays overlay cursor on top so you can see your mouse as you would see it in Notch Builder.

___ DOWNLOAD ___

The only thing you need to download is: Show Cursor Inside Notch Apps.exe
The rest of files is just open source code for curious ones : P

___ USAGE ___

Run Show Cursor Inside Notch Apps.exe and then run Notch application. Cursor should pop up by itself. To close the script just simply check Windows tray - the script icon will be there.



Peace!
